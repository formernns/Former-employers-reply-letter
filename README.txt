Dear investors,

My name is Josep Maria Sánchez, former Nanusens S.L.U. employee and investor in Nanusens through Crowdcube platform. I invested some months before starting working there.

I have recently received an email from Crowdcube with the clarification from Josep Montanyà regarding the recent posts on LinkedIn from an ex-employee, Daniel Fernández. 

We, the former employees of Nanusens S.L.U., Josep Maria Sánchez, Piotr Michalik, Claus Bauzà, Josep Àngel Oltra and Daniel Fernández, want to take this chance to answer those claims in the PDF file in this repository. This very same documentation was sent yesterday to Crowdcube with the hope that these documents circulate to all investors in the same way Josep Montanyà letter did, «for complete transparency», as Crowdcube platform state in their email. However, Crowdcube have remained silent. At the end, you, the investors, have the right to make their own informed decision on investing or not, and should be Crowdcube obligation to protect that right.

Thanking you,
Josep Maria Sánchez, on behalf also of  Piotr Michalik, Claus Bauzà, Josep Àngel Oltra and Daniel Fernández.
